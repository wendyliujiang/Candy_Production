#  Time Series Analysis on US Candy Production

# Introduction
Regardless of the occasion - be it Halloween, New Year's, or any other holiday, it's unanimous:
we all relish candy and the sweet surge of energy it offers.
Given the notable growth in the candy industry in 2022, with record sales reaching $42.6 billion,
it's evident that the sector holds significant potential. The National Confectioners Association's
data highlights the extensive consumer expenditure on various confections, including candy,
chocolate, gum, and mints.
However, the industry faces challenges. One key factor is the rising health awareness among
consumers which, while driving innovation in product development, has also led to a slowdown
in revenue growth. This necessitates the industry to be more responsive and adaptive, creating
healthier confectionery options that align with the shifting consumer preferences.
Additionally, inflation poses another hurdle, impacting prices across commodities and goods, and
potentially affecting the profit margins of candy manufacturers. As such, a deeper analysis of the
candy production data is essential to navigate these challenges and to ensure the industry's
sustainable growth.
Primarily, the focus of this project lies in forecasting future candy production volumes via a
rigorous data analysis process. This forecasting element serves as an invaluable tool for strategic
planning, empowering manufacturers to navigate with confidence through fluctuating market
conditions, irrespective of whether they present challenges or opportunities. This initiative
strengthens their resilience and adaptability within a swiftly evolving marketplace.
To supplement this primary focus, our project also emphasizes the crucial role of data
visualization. By converting time-series data into visually compelling graphical representations,
we aim to unravel intricate trends and patterns. This transformation of data into a more accessible
and comprehensible format enhances its value for industry stakeholders.
With this two-pronged approach, our project offers strategic foresight while also improving our
understanding of industry trends. This makes it an all-encompassing and invaluable resource for
candy manufacturers operating in today's dynamic market environment.
